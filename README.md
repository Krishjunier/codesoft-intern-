Overview
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning algorithms to solve multiple classification and prediction problems. It includes implementations for:
* Movie Genre Classification: Predicting movie genres based on plot summaries.
* Credit Card Fraud Detection: Identifying fraudulent transactions using transaction data.
* Customer Churn Prediction: Forecasting customer churn in subscription-based services.
* SMS Spam Detection: Classifying SMS messages as spam or legitimate.
Tasks
1. Movie Genre Classification:

* Techniques: TF-IDF, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression
* File:movie_genre_classification.py
  
2. Credit Card Fraud Detection:

* Techniques: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests
* File:credit_card_fraud_detection.py
  
3. Customer Churn Prediction:

* Techniques: Feature engineering, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting
* File:customer_churn_prediction.py
  
4. SMS Spam Detection:

* Techniques: TF-IDF, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression
* File: notebooks/sms_spam_detection.py
