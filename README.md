## Overview

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning algorithms to solve multiple classification and prediction problems. It includes implementations for:

- **Movie Genre Classification:** Predicting movie genres based on plot summaries.
- **Credit Card Fraud Detection:** Identifying fraudulent transactions using transaction data.
- **Customer Churn Prediction:** Forecasting customer churn in subscription-based services.
- **SMS Spam Detection:** Classifying SMS messages as spam or legitimate.

## Tasks

1. **Movie Genre Classification:**
   - Techniques: TF-IDF, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression
   - File: `movie_genre_classification.py`

2. **Credit Card Fraud Detection:**
   - Techniques: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests
   - File: `credit_card_fraud_detection.py`

3. **Customer Churn Prediction:**
   - Techniques: Feature engineering, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting
   - File: `customer_churn_prediction.py`

4. **SMS Spam Detection:**
   - Techniques: TF-IDF, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression
   - File: `notebooks/sms_spam_detection.py`
